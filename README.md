# Binary-Search-Tree-and-CSV-Parser
# Project Overview
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ for efficient data storage and retrieval. The BST allows for operations such as inserting, searching, and traversing nodes. Additionally, the project includes a custom CSV parser that is designed to handle and manipulate sales data from CSV files, demonstrating both file handling and data management skills.

# Features
The Binary Search Tree is implemented to efficiently perform operations like insertion, searching, and traversal of nodes. This allows for optimal performance in managing data within the tree structure, making it suitable for various applications in software engineering. The project also includes a CSV Parser that reads sales data from CSV files. This parser processes and manipulates the data, making it easy to analyze and integrate into larger systems.

# Files
The project contains several key files. BinarySearchTree.cpp houses the full implementation of the binary search tree. The CSV parser is implemented across two files, CSVparser.cpp and CSVparser.hpp, handling the reading and processing of CSV data. Additionally, sample data files eBid_Monthly_Sales.csv and eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv are included for testing purposes.
