# Binary-Search-Tree-and-CSV-Parser
Project Overview
This project implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C++ for efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, a custom CSV parser is integrated to handle and manipulate sales data from CSV files.

Features
Binary Search Tree:
Insert, search, and traverse nodes efficiently.
Implemented in C++ for optimal performance.

CSV Parser:
Reads sales data from CSV files.
Processes and manipulates data for further analysis.

Files
BinarySearchTree.cpp - Contains the implementation of the binary search tree.
CSVparser.cpp and CSVparser.hpp - Custom CSV parser implementation.
eBid_Monthly_Sales.csv and eBid_Monthly_Sales_Dec_2016.csv - Sample sales data used for testing.
